        every
        day. Currently, I work
        for Fulfillment Express as a full-stack web developer. Working as a full-stack developer at Fulfillment Express
        has taught me a lot : Not only to become a better developer, but a better worker overall. Additionally, I have
        been learning how to design a better page by utilizing design tools such as Figma. </span>
